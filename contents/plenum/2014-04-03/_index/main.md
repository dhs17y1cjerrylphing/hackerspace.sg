#### Program: Design, layout and furnishing of HackerspaceSG

- Status, objectives, issues, next actions.
- New oven, shower, shelf installed, much awesome. Bought 2 new tables. All <$350 Remaining $100 towards projector mount. Soares and Hazwan washed beanbags.
- Inform Juanita: Cleaning lady to remove/wash/replace 4*beanbag covers (no more than 2 out of service at once) quarterly, $7pp. (Roland)
- Objectives may include: more shelves, usable tables that can be put away during events
- Objectives may include: better chairs
- "doc policy about having own stuff in the space available for others when owner not around" drafted? (Valentine)
	- communal stuff
	- personal stuff (chairs, computers, monitors, keyboard, nerf gun): owner use when present, communal use when not (Valentine)
	- leaving personal stuff lying around during multi-hour absences (on tables, on floor) (please don't!) (text on Trello, put on website: Valentine)
- improve entry partition (add shelves; need to sort out which and buy them; Roland)
- towel bar(s) for toilet, need part number (CJ specify part# and qty, Roland buy, CJ [find someone to] install)
- http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/The_Old_Hardware_Pattern (Roland)
- implement stuff bucket; shelf in pantry area exclusively for cleared desks
- member pigeon holes; desirable but resource constrained at present, but note that this helps put stuff out of the way and contributes to a sense of belonging; reconsider at future date
- http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/The_Flat_Surface_Pattern revisit once we have death row operating
